## Overview
This assignment is a simple coding challenge where the goal is to find the best **buy** and **sell** prices from a list of prices to maximize profit.  
For example, given the list `[5, 2, 1, 6, 9, 7]`, the best trade is to **buy at 1** and **sell at 9**.

- **Process:**  
  - **Step 1:** Traverse the list while keeping track of the lowest price seen so far.
  - **Step 2:** Calculate the potential profit at each price by subtracting the lowest price from the current price.
